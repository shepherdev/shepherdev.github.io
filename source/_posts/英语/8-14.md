## 连续发音分析

### to

一般发/t/

在元音之间发闪音

- way to go.干的漂亮
- I can't go to the dance with my borther.
- go to  bed.

### to,do,you,know,go

他们后面有w的音，如果后面接元音会连读

- Do it.

- What's goi<u>n</u>g <u>on</u>?
- go(w) on.(做w的口型连过去)
- You'll go(w) off.
- Talk to(w) ~~h~~im.
- see you(w) again.
- yello<u>w a</u>pple.

### we are

音似were

- We're here.

- While we're a**t i**~~t~~.既然我们那样做了
- we are no~~t~~.

### hundred

两个音：hun~~dr~~e~~d~~,hundre<u>d</u>

- hundred bucks.
- 5 ~~h~~undred bucks
- eig<u>ht h</u>undred bucks.

### T+you

强调可以读you，念快了读&#679;u

- look at you

### D+you

you读jiu

- I don't need you.

### see it

e+i连读发yer

- se<u>e i</u>t.

## 发音规律

### L

首部/le/

- light
- lemon
- leg
- lion
- leapt
- luscious美味的

末尾/e/

当l结尾后面接元音时，又会发/le/

- I wil<u>l a</u>llways love you.
- sto<u>le</u> it.
- Cause I'm al<u>l a</u>bou<u>t t</u>he learnin.
- I'll tell ~~h~~er we're leaving.

### R

首部时，嘴做圆形

- Rockin
- Robot

做结尾，和l差不多

### t,d,p,k,g,b,f,v,m,n

这几个**音**相遇要省略前一个

- Is i<u>t t</u>oo soon.
- ni<u>ce su</u>it.(发音一样)
- Wha<u>t d</u>o you want.
